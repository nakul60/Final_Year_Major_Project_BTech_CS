# Nakul RPI Project
## Project Overview
The Nakul RPI Project is a comprehensive project that utilizes the Raspberry Pi to integrate various sensor modules, cameras, and DSPs to create a robust system.

## Hardware Requirements and Connections
* Sensor Modules: 
    + DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity)
    + HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic Distance Sensor)
    + LED (Light Emitting Diode)
* Cameras: 
    + Raspberry Pi Camera Module
* DSPs: 
    + None (Using Raspberry Pi's built-in processing capabilities)
* SoMs: 
    + Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4)
* FPGAs: 
    + None (Using Raspberry Pi's built-in processing capabilities)
* CM4: 
    + Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4)

## Software Dependencies
* Raspi OS (Raspberry Pi Operating System)

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Raspi OS on the Raspberry Pi
2. Connect the sensor modules, cameras, and DSPs to the Raspberry Pi
3. Configure the SoMs, FPGAs, and CM4

## Usage Guide
1. Power on the Raspberry Pi
2. Run the application

## Troubleshooting Tips
* Check the connections
* Verify the software dependencies
* Refer to the Raspi OS documentation

Note: The above documentation is a basic template and may need to be modified based on the specific requirements of the Nakul RPI Project. Additionally, the component lookup and library lookup functions may not have returned the exact components and libraries used in the project, so those sections may need to be updated accordingly.
