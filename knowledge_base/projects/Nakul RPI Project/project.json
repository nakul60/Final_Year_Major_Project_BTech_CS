  "generated_code": "Here's a basic code template for Raspberry Pi that lists some common sensor modules, cameras, and DSPs. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list and you may need to add or modify it according to your specific requirements.\n\n```python\nimport RPi.GPIO as GPIO\nfrom picamera import PiCamera\n\n# Define a function to list sensor modules\ndef list_sensor_modules():\n    sensor_modules = [\n        \"DHT22\",\n        \"HC-SR04\",\n        \"LED\"\n    ]\n    return sensor_modules\n\n# Define a function to list cameras\ndef list_cameras():\n    cameras = [\n        \"Raspberry Pi Camera Module\"\n    ]\n    return cameras\n\n# Define a function to list DSPs\ndef list_dsps():\n    dsps = [\n        \"Texas Instruments DSP\"\n    ]\n    return dsps\n\n# Define a function to list SoMs\ndef list_soms():\n    soms = [\n        \"System-on-Module (SoM)\"\n    ]\n    return soms\n\n# Define a function to list FPGAs\ndef list_fpgas():\n    fpgas = [\n        \"Xilinx FPGA\"\n    ]\n    return fpgas\n\n# Define a function to list CPNX modules\ndef list_cpnx_modules():\n    cpnx_modules = [\n        \"CPNX modules\"\n    ]\n    return cpnx_modules\n\n# Define a function to list CM5\ndef list_cm5():\n    cm5 = [\n        \"CM5\"\n    ]\n    return cm5\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    print(\"Sensor Modules:\")\n    for sensor in list_sensor_modules():\n        print(sensor)\n\n    print(\"\\nCameras:\")\n    for camera in list_cameras():\n        print(camera)\n\n    print(\"\\nDSPs:\")\n    for dsp in list_dsps():\n        print(dsp)\n\n    print(\"\\nSoMs:\")\n    for som in list_soms():\n        print(som)\n\n    print(\"\\nFPGAs:\")\n    for fpga in list_fpgas():\n        print(fpga)\n\n    print(\"\\nCPNX modules:\")\n    for cpnx in list_cpnx_modules():\n        print(cpnx)\n\n    print(\"\\nCM5:\")\n    for cm in list_cm5():\n        print(cm)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code defines several functions to list different types of components and then calls these functions in the main function to print the lists. Please note that this is a basic example and you may need to modify it according to your specific requirements.\n\nAlso, please note that the `pydsp` library is not found for the Raspberry Pi platform, so you may need to use a different library or implement the DSP functionality manually.\n\nYou can use the `RPi.GPIO` library to control the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi, and the `picamera` library to control the Raspberry Pi camera module.\n\nYou can use the `component_lookup_tool` function to look up information about specific components, such as the Raspberry Pi Camera Module, the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT, the Texas Instruments DSP, the Xilinx FPGA, the System-on-Module (SoM), the CM5, and the CPNX modules.\n\nYou can use the `library_lookup_tool` function to look up information about specific libraries, such as the `RPi.GPIO` library and the `picamera` library.\n\nYou can use the `code_validator_tool` function to validate the syntax and structure of your code.\n\nYou can use the `code_template_tool` function to generate code templates for different platforms and use cases.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",
  "documentation": "# Nakul RPI Project\n## Project Overview\nThe Nakul RPI Project is a comprehensive project that utilizes the Raspberry Pi to integrate various sensor modules, cameras, and DSPs to create a robust system.\n\n## Hardware Requirements and Connections\n* Sensor Modules: \n    + DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity)\n    + HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic Distance Sensor)\n    + LED (Light Emitting Diode)\n* Cameras: \n    + Raspberry Pi Camera Module\n* DSPs: \n    + None (Using Raspberry Pi's built-in processing capabilities)\n* SoMs: \n    + Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4)\n* FPGAs: \n    + None (Using Raspberry Pi's built-in processing capabilities)\n* CM4: \n    + Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4)\n\n## Software Dependencies\n* Raspi OS (Raspberry Pi Operating System)\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Install Raspi OS on the Raspberry Pi\n2. Connect the sensor modules, cameras, and DSPs to the Raspberry Pi\n3. Configure the SoMs, FPGAs, and CM4\n\n## Usage Guide\n1. Power on the Raspberry Pi\n2. Run the application\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n* Check the connections\n* Verify the software dependencies\n* Refer to the Raspi OS documentation\n\nNote: The above documentation is a basic template and may need to be modified based on the specific requirements of the Nakul RPI Project. Additionally, the component lookup and library lookup functions may not have returned the exact components and libraries used in the project, so those sections may need to be updated accordingly.",
