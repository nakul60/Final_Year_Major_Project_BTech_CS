# Nakul ka Major Project
## Project Overview
The Nakul ka Major Project is an Arduino-based project that aims to 
## Hardware Requirements and Connections
* Arduino Board
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires
## Software Dependencies
* Arduino IDE
## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the Arduino Board to the computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and select the correct board and port.
3. Upload the initialization code to the Arduino Board.
## Usage Guide
1. Once the code is uploaded, the Arduino Board will be initialized.
2. The user can then use the Arduino Board to control various devices.
## Troubleshooting Tips
* Check the connections between the Arduino Board and the computer.
* Make sure the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE.

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
}
```
